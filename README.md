 Im a civil engineer with a very solid intrest for programming and i would like to use it towards the aoutomation of tasks related to construction.
 I believe that the best possible enviroment to do this is trough BIM tools, given that is the technology and data management side of construction.
 I have extense knowledge on python (both within and outside dynamo), the revit API, and also great geometrical and spatial skills. 
 I have also worked with several REST APIs such as Magicplan, Fulcrum, Gogle Maps and Amazon.
 I also have a solid base on Data Science related topics such as Machine Learning Algorithms, Database managment in SQL, AWS, Dash apps on Python and interface creation with CSS
